These are my USACO notes from 3/10/2024 onwards.&#x20;

To speed up my acquisition of competitive programming skills, I want to start documenting my notes for each problem I come across and build intuition for problem-solving techniques. I also want to do my best to take away an improvement from each problem I do.&#x20;

These are completely inward-facing, and serves as an accountability measure.

My approach to USACO practice is a modified version of this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/comments/pk3tjp/the\_ultimate\_usaco\_practice\_method/](https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/comments/pk3tjp/the\_ultimate\_usaco\_practice\_method/).&#x20;
