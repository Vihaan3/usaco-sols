These are my USACO notes from 3/10/2024 onwards.&#x20;

To speed up my acquisition of competitive programming skills, I want to start documenting my notes for each problem I come across and build intuition for problem-solving techniques. I also want to do my best to take away an improvement from each problem I do.&#x20;

These are completely inward-facing, and the only reason this is even being published is because I want it to serve as an accountability measure.
