# Problem To-Do List

* Re-solving every Silver problem from the USACO 2023-2024 season
* Understand the wormhole sort implementation: [http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2\&cpid=992](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2\&cpid=992) and then re-implement it
* Take a Silver practice test from the USACO 2022-2023 season. If you do good, move on to Gold, else do more Silver practice.
