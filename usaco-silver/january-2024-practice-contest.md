# January 2024 Practice Contest

I realized later that they were all problems I'd already done a few months ago, so I had a bit of an unfair advantage.&#x20;

#### Cowmpetency

I got to test case 8 with a relatively naive solution.&#x20;

#### Potion Farming

It took me _way_ too long to come up with the right solution for this way, and in a real contest I wouldn't have finished in time.&#x20;

#### Cowlendar&#x20;

I got a correct solution, but it ended up being more complex than the official one. I kept track of all differences and used a prefix sum like technique to track for each possible L.&#x20;
