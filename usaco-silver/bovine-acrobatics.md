### Problem-Solving

I got an O(n^2) solution pretty early on that passed 9/15 test cases, but I just couldn't figure out a more optimized solution.  The official solution is elegant, and I think I would've been able to get it if I'd focused more on looking at the order of the subtasks. I try to get the best solution I can right away, and that worked in bronze, but I think it's why I'm struggling a little bit with silver.

My new problem-solving strategy will be:

1. Read through the problem, **look at the time complexity,**
2. Ignoring the time complexity for now, try to observe some patterns while solving the sample test cases&#x20;
3. Think of the most simple solution possible ignoring the time complexity and plan it out completely
4. If that solution unoptimal, bookmark it and then try to see if you can optimize it in any way AND/OR look at the subtasks and see what they might provide insight into more optimized solutions
5. Once you have a solution, test it yourself with a few hand-generated test cases
6. Write a description of the solution down
7. Write out detailed pseudo-code that is just advanced enough that it wouldn't take any brain power to implement (you've already done all the thinking)
8. Flesh that out into code
